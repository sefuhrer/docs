# {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} Live Sync (bl) commands

*Last updated: 29 January 2016*

If you are building a Node.js application, you can use Bluemixâ„¢ Live Sync to quickly update the application instance running on Bluemix and develop as you would on the desktop without redeploying. When you make a change, you can see that change in your running Bluemix application immediately. The Bluemix Live Sync command line interface is called *bl*.

You can use **bl** command line interface commands to complete the following tasks:

* Start and stop an application that is running on Bluemix.
* Create a new cloud-based project from your desktop.
* Sync changes from your desktop to the cloud-based project workspace and to the application running on Bluemix.
* See the list of projects available for synchronization.
* See the status of running applications.

For more information on downloading and using the bl command, see [Bluemix Live Sync](../develop/bluemixlive.html).
