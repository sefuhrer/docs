# Cloud Foundry Command Line Interface plug-ins

*Last updated: 2 Feburary 2016*

You can install and use Cloud Foundry Command Line Interface (cf cli) plug-ins that are available on [CLI Plug-in Repository](http://plugins.{DomainName}/){: new_window}. Each plug-in is identified by its binary file name, its developer-defined plug-in name, and the commands that the plug-in provides. You can use the binary file name only to install a plug-in, and use the plug-in name or a command for any other action.
