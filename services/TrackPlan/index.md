#Getting started with the {{site.data.keyword.trackplan}} service {: #track-plan}  

*Last Updated: 22 March 2016*

To view, edit, and plan tasks, use {{site.data.keyword.trackplanlong}} (the {{site.data.keyword.trackplan}} service). You can track your work and your team's work, create defects, see what's incoming, maintain your backlog, and plan work for future sprints.
{: shortdesc}

The {{site.data.keyword.trackplan}} service links plans and code so that plans stay in sync with the development team's progress. With the service, you can create stories, tasks, and defects to describe and track project work. You can also plan and manage the product backlog, releases, and sprints.

Complete these steps to set up the {{site.data.keyword.trackplan}} service:    

1. On the {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} app Dashboard, create a Git-hosted project for the app by clicking **Add Git Repo and Pipeline**. 
1. Make sure that the **Populate the repo with the starter app package and enable the Build & Deploy pipeline** check box is selected and then click **CONTINUE**.   
1. After your Git repository is created, click **CLOSE**. The Add Git button is replaced by an Edit Code button and your Git URL.  
1. To add the {{site.data.keyword.deliverypipeline}} service to the associated space or spaces, click **Connect New**, click the **DevOps** category, click **Track & Plan**, and click **Create**.
   
On the {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} Dashboard, you can see your {{site.data.keyword.jazzhub_short}} projects and their member counts, visibility, and whether they have the {{site.data.keyword.trackplan}} service enabled. You can create work items for any of your {{site.data.keyword.jazzhub_short}} projects or go to your planning tools.
