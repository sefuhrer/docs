{: #getting-started}

The {{site.data.keyword.amafull}} service gives your mobile application security and monitoring functionality. You can configure client authentication and identity providers. You can also add monitoring function to your app that enables both client logging and usage statistics.

Note: The {{site.data.keyword.amashort}} service was previously known as Advanced Mobile Access.

1. Set up a mobile backend in Bluemix and configure the SDK in your mobile app. For more information, see [Getting started](getting-started.html).
1. Secure server-side resources. Protect your mobile backend resources that are running on Node.js or Liberty for Java&trade; runtimes with mobile-enabled OAuth security. For more information, see [Protecting resources](protecting-resources.html).
1. Optional: Configure an identity provider for your application. You can configure one identity provider per application. Configuring an identity provider enables the users of your mobile app to log in with their existing Facebook or Google+ account. Or, you can define how users log in by creating a custom authentication.
