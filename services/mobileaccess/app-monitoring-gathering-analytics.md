# Gathering usage analytics
{: #usage-analytics}

You can configure the {{site.data.keyword.amashort}} client SDK to record usage analytics and send the recorded data to the {{site.data.keyword.amashort}} service.

**Note:** Ensure that you have enabled logging capture before you start recording usage analytics.

Use the following APIs to start recording and sending usage analytics:

### Android
{: #usage-analytics-android}

```Java
// Enable recording of usage analytics
MFPAnalytics.enable();

// Start recording application startup time
// Add this code in the onCreate method of your main Activity
MFPAnalytics.startLoggingApplicationStartup();

// Record the duration of application startup
// Add this code in the onStart method of your main Activity
MFPAnalytics.logApplicationStartup();

// Record application foreground and background events
// Add this code in the onPause and onResume methods of your main Activity
MFPAnalytics.logSessionStart();
MFPAnalytics.logSessionEnd();

// Send recorded usage analytics to the {{site.data.keyword.amashort}} Service
MFPAnalytics.send();
```

### iOS - Objective-C
{: #usage-analytics-objectc}

```Objective-C
// Enable usage analytics recording
[[IMFAnalytics sharedInstance] setEnabled:YES];

// Start recording application lifecycle events
[[IMFAnalytics sharedInstance] startRecordingApplicationLifecycleEvents];


// Send recorded usage analytics to the {{site.data.keyword.amashort}} Service
[[IMFAnalytics sharedInstance] sendPersistedLogs];
```

### iOS - Swift
{: #usage-analytics-swift}

```Swift
// Enable usage analytics recording
IMFAnalytics.sharedInstance().setEnabled(true)

// Start recording application lifecycle events
IMFAnalytics.sharedInstance().startRecordingApplicationLifecycleEvents()


// Send recorded usage analytics to the {{site.data.keyword.amashort}} Service
IMFAnalytics.sharedInstance().sendPersistedLogs()
```

### Cordova
{: #usage-analytics-cordova}

```JavaScript
// Enable usage analytics recording
MFPAnalytics.enable();

// Send recorded usage analytics to the {{site.data.keyword.amashort}} Service
MFPAnalytics.send();
```
**Note:** When you are developing Cordova applications, use the native API to enable application lifecycle event recording.
