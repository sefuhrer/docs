# Enabling Google authentication in iOS apps (Swift SDK)
{: #google-auth-ios}

## Before you begin
{: #google-auth-ios-before}

* You must have a resource that is protected by {{site.data.keyword.amashort}} and an iOS project that is instrumented with the {{site.data.keyword.amashort}} client SDK.  For more information, see [Getting started with {{site.data.keyword.amashort}}](https://console.{DomainName}/docs/services/mobileaccess/getting-started.html) and [Setting up the iOS Swift SDK](https://console.{DomainName}/docs/services/mobileaccess/getting-started-ios-swift-sdk.html).  
* Manually protect your backend application with {{site.data.keyword.amashort}} server SDK. For more information, see [Protecting resources](https://console.{DomainName}/docs/services/mobileaccess/protecting-resources.html).

## Preparing your app for Google sign-in
{: #google-sign-in-ios}

Prepare your app for Google sign-in by following the instructions Google provides at [Goolge Sign-In for iOS](https://developers.google.com/identity/sign-in/ios/start-integrating) provided by Google. The following steps give you a brief outline of tasks you must do to prepare your app.

1. Enable Google Sign-In for iOS for your app. For more information, see [Try Sign-In for iOS](https://developers.google.com/identity/sign-in/ios/start?ver=swift).

1. Get a configuration file (`GoogleService-Info.plist`) for you project. To get the file, see [Enable Google services for your app](https://developers.google.com/mobile/add?platform=ios).

 **Important:** When you get the `GoogleService-Info.plist` file, open it and note the `CLIENT_ID` value. You need this value later to configure {{site.data.keyword.amashort}}.

1. Add the `GoogleService-Info.plist` file to your Xcode project. For more information, see [Add the configuration file to your project](https://developers.google.com/identity/sign-in/ios/start-integrating#add-config)

1. Update the URL Schemes in your Xcode project with your `REVERSE_CLIENT_ID` and bundle identifier. For more information, see [Add URL schemes to your project](https://developers.google.com/identity/sign-in/ios/start-integrating#add_url_schemes_to_your_project).

1. Update your app's project-Bridging-Header.h file with the following code:

 ```
 #import <Google/SignIn.h>
 ```

 For more information about updating the bridging header file, see step 1. in [Enable sign-in](https://developers.google.com/identity/sign-in/ios/sign-in#enable_sign-in).

## Configuring {{site.data.keyword.amashort}} for Google authentication
{: #google-auth-ios-config}

Now that you have an iOS client ID, you can enable Google authentication in the {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix}} dashboard.

1. Open your app in the {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} dashboard.

1. Click **Mobile Options** and take note of **Route** (*applicationRoute*) and **App GUID** (*applicationGUID*). You need these values when you initialize the SDK.

1. Click the {{site.data.keyword.amashort}} tile. The {{site.data.keyword.amashort}} dashboard loads.

1. Click the **Google** tile.

1. In **Application ID for iOS**, specify the `CLIENT_ID` value from the `GoogleService-Info.plist` file that you obtained earlier and click **Save**.

## Configuring the {{site.data.keyword.amashort}} client SDK for iOS
{: #google-auth-ios-sdk}

### Installing CocoaPods
{: #google-auth-cocoapods}

The {{site.data.keyword.amashort}} client SDK is distributed with CocoaPods, a dependency manager for iOS projects. CocoaPods automatically downloads artifacts from repositories and makes them available to your iOS application.

1. Open Terminal and run `pod --version` command. If you already have CocoaPods installed, the version number is displayed. You can skip to the next section of this tutorial.

1. Install CocoaPods by running `sudo gem install cocoapods`. Refer to [CocoaPods website](https://cocoapods.org/) in case additional guidance is required.

1. Close XCode.

1. Open Terminal and `cd` into your project directory.

1.  Run `pod init`.

### Installing the {{site.data.keyword.amashort}} client SWift SDK using CocoaPods
{: #google-auth-ios-sdk-cocoapods}

1. Navigate to your iOS project.

1. Edit the `Podfile` to add the following lines:

 ```
 use_frameworks!
 pod 'BMSGoogleAuthentication'
 ```
 **Tip:** You can add `use_frameworks!` to your Xcode target instead of having it in the Podfile.

1. Save the `Podfile` and run `pod install` from the command line. CocoaPods  installs the dependencies. You will see the progress and which components were added.

 **Important**: You now must open your project by using the `xcworkspace` file that is generated by CocoaPods. Usually the name is `{your-project-name}.xcworkspace`.  

1. Run `open {your-project-name}.xcworkspace` from the command line to open your iOS project workspace.

1. Copy the `GoogleAuthenticationManager.swift` file from the `BMSGoogleAuthentication` pod source files to your project directory.

## Initializing the {{site.data.keyword.amashort}} client Swift SDK
{: #google-auth-ios-initialize}

To use the {{site.data.keyword.amashort}} client SDK,  initialize it by passing the `applicationGUID`, and `applicationRoute` parameters.

A common, though not mandatory, place to put the initialization code is in the `application:didFinishLaunchingWithOptions` method of your application delegate.

1. Get your application parameter values. Open your app in the {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} dashboard. Click **Mobile Options**. The `applicationRoute` and `applicationGUID` values are displayed in the **Route** and **App GUID** fields.

1. Import the required frameworks in the class where you want to use the {{site.data.keyword.amashort}} client SDK. Add the following headers:

 ```Swift
 import UIKit
 import BMSCore
 import BMSSecurity
 ```

1. Use the following code to initialize the client SDK. Replace the `<applicationRoute>` and `<applicationGUID>` with values for **Route** and **App GUID** that you obtained from **Mobile Options** in the {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} dashboard.

 ```Swift
 let backendURL = "<applicationRoute>"
 let backendGUID = "<applicationGUID>"

 func application(application: UIApplication, didFinishLaunchingWithOptions launchOptions: [NSObject: AnyObject]?) -> Bool {

 // Initialize the client SDK.  
 BMSClient.sharedInstance.initializeWithBluemixAppRoute(backendURL, bluemixAppGUID: backendGUId, bluemixRegion: BMSClient.<application Bluemix region>)

 BMSClient.sharedInstance.authorizationManager = MCAAuthorizationManager.sharedInstance

 GoogleAuthenticationManager.sharedInstance.register()
      return true
      }

 // [START openurl]
      func application(application: UIApplication,
          openURL url: NSURL, sourceApplication: String?, annotation: AnyObject) -> Bool {
             return GoogleAuthenticationManager.sharedInstance.handleApplicationOpenUrl(openURL: url, sourceApplication: sourceApplication, annotation: annotation)
      }

 @available(iOS 9.0, *)
 func application(app: UIApplication, openURL url: NSURL, options: [String : AnyObject]) -> Bool {
 return GoogleAuthenticationManager.sharedInstance.handleApplicationOpenUrl(openURL: url, options: options)
  }
 ```

## Testing the authentication
{: #google-auth-ios-testing}

After the client SDK is initialized and Google Authentication Manager is registered, you can start making requests to your mobile backend.

### Before you begin
{: #google-auth-ios-testing-before}

You must be using the {{site.data.keyword.mobilefirstbp}}  boilerplate and already have a resource protected by {{site.data.keyword.amashort}} at the `/protected` endpoint. If you need to set up a `/protected` endpoint, see [Protecting resources](https://console.{DomainName}/docs/services/mobileaccess/protecting-resources.html).


1. Try to send a request to protected endpoint of your mobile backend in your desktop browser by opening `{applicationRoute}/protected`, for example `http://my-mobile-backend.mybluemix.net/protected`

1. The `/protected` endpoint of a mobile backend created with MobileFirst Services Boilerplate is protected with {{site.data.keyword.amashort}}, therefore it can only be accessed by mobile applications instrumented with {{site.data.keyword.amashort}} client SDK. As a result you will see `Unauthorized` in your desktop browser.

1. Use your iOS application to make request to the same endpoint.

 ```Swift
 let protectedResourceURL = "<Your protected resource URL>" // any protected resource
 let request = Request(url: protectedResourceURL , method: HttpMethod.GET)
 let callBack:BmsCompletionHandler = {(response: Response?, error: NSError?) in
 if error == nil {
    print ("response:\(response?.responseText), no error")
 } else {
    print ("error: \(error)")
 }
 }

 request.sendWithCompletionHandler(callBack)
	```

1. Run your application. You will see a Google Login screen pop-up

 ![image](images/ios-google-login.png)

1. When you log in and click **OK**, you're authorizing {{site.data.keyword.amashort}} to use your Google user identity for authentication purposes.

1. 	Your request should succeed. You should see the following output in the log.

 ```
 onAuthenticationSuccess info = Optional({attributes = {};
     deviceId = 105747725068605084657;
     displayName = "donlonqwerty@gmail.com";
     isUserAuthenticated = 1;
     userId = 105747725068605084657;
 })
 response:Optional("Hello, this is a protected resource!"), no error
 ```

1. You can also add logout functionality by adding the following code:

 ```
 GoogleAuthenticationManager.sharedInstance.logout(callBack)
 ```

  If you call this code after a user is logged in with Google and the user tries to log in again, they are prompted to authorize {{site.data.keyword.amashort}} to use Google for authentication purposes. At that point, the user can click the user name in the upper-right corner of the screen to select and login with another user.

   Passing `callBack` to the logout function is optional. You can also pass `nil`.
