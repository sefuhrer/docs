# Sending basic push notifications

{: #push-send-notifications}

After you have developed your applications, you can send basic push notifications (without using tags, badges, additional payloads, or sound files).


Send basic push notifications.

1. In **Choose the Audience**, select one of the following audiences: **All Devices**, or by platform: **Only iOS devices** or **Only Anroid devices**.

	**Note**: When you select the **All Devices** option, all the devices that have subscribed to push notifications receive your notification.
