<!-- This template is for getting started with a Bluemix service. It is a task template intended to document productive use of the service. It is not intended for discovery and conceptual information.  -->

<!-- The name of this file should remain index.md.
Please delete out content examples and coding that you are not using for your service. -->

# Getting started with {{site.data.keyword.mobileappbuilder_short}} (Experimental)
<!-- Insert your short service name into topic title above -->
{: #gettingstartedtemplate}
<!-- Provide and appropriate ID above -->
*Last updated: 29 April 2016*

<!-- Short description: REQUIRED
The short description section should include one to three sentences describing why a developer would want to use your service in an app. This should be conversational style. For search engine optimization, include the service long name and "Bluemix". Keep the {: shortdesc} after the first paragraph so that the framework renders it properly.

Examples: -->

{{site.data.keyword.mobileappbuilder_full}} helps you create your mobile app. You can start from scratch or choose from various templates to help guide the creation of your app.

<!-- If overview content is required, do not include it here. Put it in a separate "## About" section below the task section. -->

<!-- Task section: REQUIRED
The task section includes steps to integrate the service into the app.  
- With task-based, technical information, reduce the conversational style in favor of succinct and direct instructions.
- DO include the basic, most-common-use scenario steps to use the service or integrate it into the app.
- DO NOT include steps to add the service from the Bluemix catalog; we assume that the user already took steps in the UI to add the service.
- DO include code snippets in all languages that can be copied, as well as VCAP service info.  
- For additional tasks like configuring, managing, etc., add a task section (## Gerund_task_title) below the task section or "About" section if used. Use a task title such as "Configuring x", "Administering y", "Managing z". -->

<!-- You can include an optional prerequisites paragraph for any prerequisites to be met before integrating the service. For example: -->

<!-- TODO: Before an application developer can embed single sign-on capability into an app, the administrator must create unbound service instances by using the Bluemix user interface. -->

<!-- Include a sentence to briefly introduce the steps. Examples: -->

Complete these steps to get started with the {{site.data.keyword.mobileappbuilder_short}} service:

<!-- Use ordered list markup for the step section. For code examples:
- use three backticks ahead of and after the example (```)
- For copyable code snippet, multi-line, include {: codeblock} following the last set of backticks. A copy button will display in framework in output.
- For copyable command, single line, include {: pre} following the last set of backticks. When displayed, it will show "$" at the beginning of the command example and a copy button, but the copy button will include just the command example.
- For non-copyable output snippet, include {: screen} following the last set of backticks.
