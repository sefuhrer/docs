## {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} Local architecture
{: #localarch}

{{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} Local sits on a virtual machine that is behind your company firewall, providing the highest performing and most secure cloud infrastructure to you. IBM installs, remotely monitors, and manages {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} Local in your data center through IBM's Relay technology. Review the following diagram for information about how {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} is set up in your local environment and how IBM maintains your local instance:

![{{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} Local.](images/localarch.png "Bluemix Local architecture diagram")

*Figure 1. {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} Local architecture*

The inception virtual machine runs behind your customer firewall in a network that has outbound connectivity to the IBM operations center through Relay. The {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} platform components and core features that support the platform components run in a private, isolated virtual local area network (VLAN). {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} Local uses a VLAN for the private subnet. Using a private subnet rather than a public VLAN is more secure and can help avoid routing issues. The set of core features that support the platform include the following:

<dl>
<dt>**Monitoring and logging**</dt>
<dd>The monitoring and logging features are deployed in your data centers through Relay, and the data remains in your data center. Alerts are sent back to IBM operations based on the defined alert criteria. No sensitive information is included in the alerts that are sent back to IBM.</dd>
<dt>**Network**</dt>
<dd>Relay is the delivery network included with {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} Local. Relay enables IBM to automatically and consistently deliver the latest updates to all local deployments, so that you always have an up-to-date and secure system. The traffic on this tunnel is automated activity for serving and maintaining the platform, compute resources, and services for your instance. The traffic includes the monitoring capability that is used by IBM operations to complete problem determination for your local instance. For more information about Relay, see [Relay](index.html#localrelay).</dd>
<dt>**Compute**</dt>
<dd>{{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} Local uses app-centric runtime environments based on Cloud Foundry.</dd>
<dt>**Security intelligence**</dt>
<dd><p>IBM uses QRadar Security Intelligence Platform to provide a unified architecture for integrating several key components. These components include security information and event management, log management, anomaly detection, incident forensics, and configuration and vulnerability management. Bluemix also uses IBM QRadar security information and event management (SIEM) to monitor privileged user actions and successful and unsuccessful login attempts of application developers. QRadar reports provide the customer with visibility on that events data via the Reports and Logs section of the Administration page. For information about security reports, see [Viewing reports](../admin/index.html#oc_report).</p>
<p>IBM BigFix ensures that fixes for operating systems are applied at appropriate frequencies. The patching process is automated, and the schedule is agreed upon between you and IBM. For information about maintenance and upgrades, see [Maintaining your local instance](index.html#maintainlocal).</p>
</dd>
</dl>

Your apps are deployed inside virtual containers that run on Cloud Foundry virtual machines. All Cloud Foundry components, such as cloud controllers, health managers, routers, and droplet execution agents (DEAs) are deployed when {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} is set up. The various {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} management components are also included in the {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} deployment.

DataPower appliances provide access to {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} application domains. These appliances connect to the network that is accessible  from your intranet. Your users who are deploying apps and services get access from the network that is accessible from your intranet. You must provide seven IP addresses that have outbound internet access. DataPower appliances route from these customer IP addresses to the isolated {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} deployment. For information about the network specifications and infrastructure requirements, see [{{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} Local infrastructure requirements](../local/index.html#localinfra).

### Relay
{: #localrelay}

Relay is a delivery capability that is included with {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} Local. Relay enables IBM to automatically and consistently deliver the latest updates to all local deployments, so that you always have an up-to-date and secure system. Relay achieves secure connectivity through an open, outbound SSL, VPN tunnel that originates from the inception virtual machine on-premises by using certificates that are specific to each {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} Local instance. All initial {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} releases are available in the inception virtual machine, which also acts as an automation agent machine for deployments and updates. The SSL connection originates from the inception virtual machine.  After a secure connection is established back to the {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} automation server, IBM checks for the currency and consistency of {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} releases, and begins deploying updates.

The traffic on this tunnel is automated activity for serving and maintaining the platform, compute resources, and services for your instance. The traffic includes the monitoring capability that is used by IBM operations to complete problem determination for your local instance. The outbound web port 443 is used for this connection. IBM uses the Relay capability to deliver platform updates through a consistent testing and validation. This process ensures that all deployments that are pushed to your local environments are stable and secure.

Only the IBM team that is working with you on your local environment can securely access your {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} instance. Access to your local environment is secured by using two-factor authentication during multiple steps in the connection process. IBM provides a list of the approved users and IDs who can access your environment, and then you can audit any access to your environment. By generating a security report, you are able to find out who accessed your environment, and when and why it was accessed. For information about generating the security reports, see [Security reports](../security/index.html#reports).

The environment is completely visible to you, as the administrator, for incident, problem, change, capacity, and security management. You can  access the information about your environment by using the Administration page. Relay technology keeps the Administration page current with the latest data. For more information about user access, security logs, syndicated catalog control, and communication for updates and problem repair, see [Managing {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} Local and {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} Dedicated](../admin/index.html#mng).

##Setting up your {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} Local instance
{: #setuplocal}

{{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} Local is designed to provide a private version of the {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} Public offering that is hosted on your own hardware, managed by you. You can use {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} services and runtimes to support your computing needs in a secure, customer-hosted and managed cloud environment.

IBM provides you access to {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} Local by using a password-secured login. You can access the services, runtimes, and associated resources, and deploy and remove {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} apps. Review the following steps for working with your IBM representative to set up your local instance of {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}}.

To set up your private version of {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}}:

## {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} Local infrastructure requirements
{: #localinfra}

For {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} Local, you own the physical security and the infrastructure for hosting the local instance. IBM sets the following minimum requirements for setting up {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} Local.

### Hardware

While there are requirements for the type and size of available hardware, you can choose any combination to meet the set resource total requirements.

<dl>
<dt>**VMware ESXi hardware**</dt>
<dd>
ESXi is a virtualization layer that runs on physical servers and that abstracts processor, memory, storage, and resources into multiple virtual machines. Choose any combination that meets the following resource totals, on the condition that minimum physical core count per ESXi is eight. The following specifications are for the {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} core runtime only.
<ul>
<li>48 Physical cores at 2.0 or more GHz each</li>
<li>756 GB of physical RAM</li>
<li>Total datastore size of 7.5 TB
<ul>
<li>7 TB datastore to hold {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}}</li>
<li>500 GB datastore to hold the inception virtual machine</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> If you use multiple datastores, use the same prefix for each.</p>
</dd>
<dt>**High availability**</dt>
<dd>
To support a single node failure, you must have n+1 ESXi. For example, if three ESXis are used, meaning 16x cores each, then a fourth is needed.
<p><strong>Note:</strong> The customer VMware administrator can decide to enforce strict high availability failover in the cluster to guarantee resources.</p>
</dd>
<dt>**Network**</dt>
<dd>
Recommended requirements include a customer accessible port group with seven customer network IP addresses that have outbound internet access in the same subnet. Two ports are used by the inception virtual machine, three ports are virtual IP addresses used for the domains, and the final two are public IP addresses for the DataPowers. Then, you define a second private VLAN between only the ESXis being used for {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} Local. This VLAN is shown as a port group in VMware. {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} Local uses it for the private subnet, which is more secure and can help avoid routing issues.<br />
<p>The following ports are used:</p>
<ul>
<li>Port 443 for the Relay connection
<p>**Note**: If you choose to use an IPSec tunnel instead of an OpenVPN, then you open a customer port for this connection.</p></li>
<li>Port 389 or SSL 636 for the LDAP or Active Directory connection</li>
</ul>
<p>**Note**: IBM can detect if the network connection is lost. In the event that network connection is lost, IBM contacts you and works with your network specialist to resolve the issue.</p>
</dd>
<dt>**Network uplinks**</dt>
<dd>Use two or more interfaces that range from 1 to 10 Gbps, depending on the intended workload for the system.</dd>
</dl>

### vCenter server configuration

Review the following version, datacenter, resource pool, and datastore requirements.

<dl>
<dt>**Supported VMware versions**</dt>
<dd>vCenter and ESXi 5.1, 5.5, and 6.0</dd>
<dt>**Supported VMware types**</dt>
<dd>vSphere Enterprise<br />
vSphere Enterprise plus, if you plan to use distributed virtual switches</dd>
<dt>**Datacenter**</dt>
<dd>Create a datacenter, if one does not exist.</dd>
<dt>**Datacenter folder**</dt>
<dd>Create a VM folder with the same name as the cluster, if you do not plan to grant Administrator access that is propagated from the datacenter.</dd>
<dt>**Cluster**</dt>
<dd>Create a cluster specifically for {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} Local use. An example for the cluster name is `bluemix`.</dd>
<dt>**Resource pool**</dt>
<dd>Create a resource pool under the {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} Local cluster. An example for resource pool name is `local`.</dd>
</dt>**Datastores**</dt>
<dd>Requires 7.5 TB for the initial deployment of {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}}.<br />
<br />
**Note**: When you use more than one datastore, ensure that each one begins with the same prefix. Examples of multiple datastore names with the same prefix are `bluemix_datastore_01` and `bluemix_datastore_02`.</dd>
<dt>**Network**</dt>
<dd>You must have one customer accessible network with outbound internet capability. The VLAN hosts the private subnet where the Bluemix Local components run. All traffic is routed from the private subnet to the customer subnet. A customer subnet IP is used for all access to Bluemix Local. Then, you can define a second private VLAN between only the ESXis being used for Bluemix Local. This VLAN is shown as a port group in VMware. Bluemix Local uses it for the private subnet, which is more secure and can help avoid routing issues.
<p>If you are using vSphere distributed switches (vDS), create a folder to hold the vDS, and place the vDS inside the folder.</p>
</dl>

### Network Bandwidth for Relay

Recommended throughput is 5 Mbps up and 5 Mbps down, and you can expect a monthly data usage of 10 GB. IBM establishes agreed upon windows when large bundles of data are delivered, which can be as large as 4 GB.

### VMware permissions

Set the following roles and permissions. Propagation is set for each permission. If the permission is propagated, the permission gets passed down through the object hierarchy. However, permissions for a child object always override permissions that are propagated from a parent object.

<dl>
<dt>**vCenter Server**</dt>
<dd>Set the role as read-only and not propagated.<br />
<br />
**Note**: This role is needed to retrieve task status for specific disk operations.</dd>
<dt>**Datacenter**</dt>
<dd>Create the role "{{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}}" and grant the following permissions:
<ul>
<li>For **Datastore**, set **Low level file operations** and **Update virtual machine files**.</li>
<li>For **vApp**, set **Import**.</li>
<li>For **dvPort** group, set **Modify**. This is for vDS use only.</li>
</ul>
**Note**: This role is needed to support file posts to the datastores.</dd>
<dt>**Cluster**</dt>
<dd>Set the role as administrator and propagated.</dd>
<dt>**Datastores**</dt>
<dd>Set the role administrator and propagated for each {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} datastore.</dd>
<dt>**Network**</dt>
<dd><ul>
<li>For vSwitch, set public and private port groups with the administrator role, not propagated.</li>
<li>For vDS parent folder, set as read-only and propagated.</li>
<li>For vDS, set public and private port groups with the administrator role, not propogated.</li>
</ul>
</dd>
</dl>

### Increasing the Droplet Execution Agent (DEA) pool
Each DEA is configured with:
- 16 - 32 GB of RAM
- 2x - 4x vCPU
- 150 - 300 GB of storage

For example, if the ESXi host size is 256 GB of memory with 16x cores, then eight DEAs are added. If the ESXi host size is 64 GB of memory with 8x cores, then two ESXis and four DEAs are required to be added. An additional 1.5 TB of storage is required for every four DEAs. This example is based on a DEA configured with 32 GB of RAM, 4x vCPU, and 300 GB of storage.

## Maintaining your local instance
{: #maintainlocal}

IBM maintains and installs updates and fixes as IBM deems appropriate to the Bluemix Local platform, runtimes, and services. Services might not be available during maintenance windows.

The following types of maintenance are required for {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} Local:
<dl>
<dt>**Standard maintenance for services**</dt>
<dd>The services utilize pre-defined, standard maintenance windows, which might cause the services to be unavailable. IBM does not require customer approval to perform maintenance, but attempts to minimize impact to your services.<br />
<br />
IBM sends broadcast messages of the changes that are planned for each maintenance window, through email, phone, or other methods.<br />
<br />
**Important**: Some service might not be available to you during the maintenance period.</dd>

<dt>**Standard maintenance for {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}}**</dt>
<dd>Maintenance updates are applied based on coordination between you and IBM within a 21-day window. You can provide IBM with specific dates or times within the 21-day window that might not work for you. IBM attempts to schedule updates around those times. Based on the requests, IBM communicates the scheduled maintenance window to you. Monthly change windows are not expected to impact the running Bluemix Local environment.
<p>The following image shows the process from receiving a notification about a pending update to setting dates that might not work for you, and then finally receiving the notification about the scheduled date:</p>
<p><img src="images/maintenance_dates.png" alt="Process for setting unavailable dates for a maintenance update"></p>
<br />
**Note**: If you do not need to set any unavailable dates for the update, then you can approve the update. IBM then notifies you of the scheduled date for the maintenance to be applied.<br />
<br />
Go to **ADMINISTRATION > SYSTEM INFORMATION** to view pending updates, set unavailable dates, and approve updates. For more information about notifications and scheduling pending updates, see <a href="../admin/index.html#oc_system">Viewing system information</a>.</dd>
</dl>

**Important**: IBM reserves the right to interrupt services to apply emergency maintenance as needed. IBM might change scheduled maintenance hours, but notifies you of any such changes, as well as any emergency maintenance information.

To set up maintenance of your local instance, work with your CSM to identify an agreed upon window for the standard maintenance. If there is a reported issue following a maintenance update, you agree with your CSM, if it is in your best interest to allow IBM to roll back the update. Upon agreement, IBM rolls back the update to restore the environment to the previous state.

## Incident response and support
{: #incidentresponse}

## Disaster recovery
{: #dr}

{{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_short}} Public provides a continuously available platform for innovation. Multiple fail-safe measures ensure that your orgs, spaces, and apps are always available. Deploying apps to multiple geographic regions enables continuous availability that protects against unplanned, simultaneous loss of multiple hardware or software components, or the loss of an entire data center, so that even in the event of a natural disaster in one geographic location, your distributed {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} Public app instances in alternate geographic locations will be available.
{: shortdesc}

Disaster recovery for {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_short}} Local is made possible through continuous availability for your apps, the inherent high availability of the platform, and the ability to restore your instance in the event of a failure. You are responsible for enabling continuous availability of your apps by deploying to multiple regions. High availability is built in at the platform level through technologies included in Cloud Foundry and other components. And, you can work together with IBM to ensure that your data is properly backed up in the case that you need to restore your instance at any time.

### Enabling continuous availability for {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} Local
{: #enabling}

By default, {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} Public deploys to multiple geographic locations. However, you must do the following to enable globally distributed {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} Local instances:

* Ensure that your developers are deploying apps in more than one region, either through a manual or automated process. Selected regions should be more than 200 km apart from each other to ensure that a natural disaster cannot affect both geographic locations.
* Configure a global load balancer, like Akamai or Dyn, to point to apps in at least two different regions.

**Note**: Not all {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} services support regional distribution. When you construct an app, if you want to achieve geographic distribution, then you must also make sure that the services that are used by that app have data synchronization as a key feature.

#### Deploying {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} Local apps to multiple geographic locations
{: #deploying}

To deploy into a second location or multiple locations, you must follow a process similar to the one you took to enable your primary geographic location:

1. Enable a new local environment to host additional instances of your applications. To create a new environment, contact your IBM sales team to initiate the process. For more information about setting up a local instance, see [Setting up {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} Local](../local/index.html#setuplocal). You must log in separately to access each environment. Each physical location for the hosted environments should be a minimum of 200 km away from the original location to ensure availability.
2. Obtain the unique domain name where your new deployed app will be hosted. For example, if your original domain is *mycompany.east.bluemix.net*, then you can create a new local environment with a new domain such as *mycompany.west.bluemix.net*, and deploy to the new domain.
3. Deploy to the new location each time you deploy your original app. For more information about deploying, see [Uploading your app](../starters/upload_app.html).


#### Enabling a global load balancer for {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} Local
{: #glb}

A global load balancer not only ensures continuous availability and is required for disaster recovery, but it also has several additional benefits:

* Routes users to the closest {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} region by default
* Routes based on performance
* Selectively directs a percentage of traffic to a new application version
* Provides site failover based on region health check
* Provides site failover based on application health check
* Uses weighted routing between endpoints

You can choose a global load balancer such as Akamai or Dyn. For more about using Akamai as a global load balancer, see [Global traffic management](https://www.akamai.com/us/en/solutions/products/web-performance/global-traffic-management.jsp){: new_window}. For more about using Dyn as a global load balancer, see [4 Reasons Businesses Are Taking Global Load Balancing to the Cloud](http://dyn.com/blog/4-reasons-businesses-are-taking-global-load-balancing-to-the-cloud/){: new_window}.

### High availability
{: #ha}

In addition to enabling continuous availability, {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} also provides high availability across the platform by using technologies built into Cloud Foundry and other components.

These technologies include the following:

<dl>
<dt>DEA Scalability in Cloud Foundry</dt>
<dd>A Cloud Foundry <a href="https://docs.cloudfoundry.org/concepts/architecture/execution-agent.html" target="_blank">Droplet Execution Agent (DEA)</a> performs health checks on the apps running within it. If there is a problem with the app or the DEA itself, it deploys additional instances of the app to an alternate DEA to address the issue. For more information, see <a href="https://docs.cloudfoundry.org/concepts/high-availability.html" target="_blank">Configuring CF for High Availability with Redundancy</a>.<br />
<p>To ensure high availability for your applications, you need enough compute resources to balance the load, and you might also require additional compute resources to support a possible failure. If you need to scale your environment by increasing your DEA pool to be prepared for a failure or address a spike in the load for your app instances, you can work with your IBM representative to order additional DEAs and ensure that you have the appropriate hardware to support the added resources.
</p>
</dd>
<dt>Metadata backup</dt>
<dd>Metadata is backed up to a secondary location, typically an on-premises virtual machine. If possible, you should replicate the backup to your own environment at least 200 km away.</dd>
</dl>

## Restoring your local instance
{: #restorelocal}

{{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} Local settings, metadata, and configurations are backed up regularly to prepare for any unplanned outages in the environment. Your data that you are responsible for backing up includes application data, cloud database services data, and object stores.

As part of the data backup, which includes system metadata and configurations, IBM completes the following tasks:

<ul>
<li>Encrypts all backup copies and manages encryption keys</li>
<li>Monitors and manages backup activity</li>
<li>Provides the encrypted backup files</li>
<li>Restores the requested data</li>
<li>Manages scheduling conflicts between backup and fix management operations</li>
</ul>

Because protection of private data is critical, IBM needs your collaboration when dealing with backup file management, so that the files are not moved outside of your data centers. Specifically, IBM asks that you complete the following tasks:

<ul>
<li>Move a copy of your encrypted backup data off-site, just as you would for any other backup data that you manage.</li>
<li>Provide the backup files for the IBM operator in case of any need to restore.</li>
</ul>
