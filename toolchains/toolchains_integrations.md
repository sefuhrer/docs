# Tool integrations (Experimental)
{: #integrations}

*Last updated: 18 April 2016*

Important: This capability is experimental. Toolchains might not be stable and might change in ways that are not compatible with earlier versions. They are not recommended for use in production environments. To use toolchains, you must make a one-time [request for access](https://new-console.ng.bluemix.net/devops?cm_mmc=IBMBluemixGarageMethod-_-MethodSite-_-10-19-15::12-31-18-_-toolchains-welcome-page){: new_window}.  Toolchains are available in the Dallas region only.

## Delivery Pipeline
{: #deliverypipeline}

The {{site.data.keyword.deliverypipeline}} automates the continuous deployment of your projects through sequences of stages that retrieve input and run jobs, such as builds, tests, and deployments.

To learn more, see [Delivery Pipeline](https://www.ibm.com/devops/method/content/deliver/tool_build_and_deploy/){: new_window}.


## Eclipse Orion {{site.data.keyword.webide}}
{: #webide}

The Eclipse Orion {{site.data.keyword.webide}} is an integrated web-based environment where you can create, edit, run, debug, and complete source control tasks. You can seamlessly move from editing to running to submitting to deploying.

To learn more, see [Web IDE](https://www.ibm.com/devops/method/content/code/tool_web_ide/){: new_window}.


## GitHub and GitHub Issues
{: #github}

GitHub is a web-based hosting service for Git repositories. You can have both local and remote copies of your projects, which makes it easy to collaborate. 

GitHub Issues is a tracking tool that is integrated with your development repository. It makes it easier for you to focus on important tasks and keep plans up to date simultaneously. GitHub Issues keeps your work and your plans all in one place.

To learn more, see [GitHub](https://www.ibm.com/devops/method/content/code/tool_github/){: new_window} and [GitHub Issues](https://www.ibm.com/devops/method/content/think/tool_github_issues/){: new_window}.


## PagerDuty
{: #pagerduty}

PagerDuty integrates data from multiple monitoring systems into a single view. When a problem occurs, the PagerDuty configuration ensures that the team member who is best able to fix it at the time is notified. If the team member does not respond to the problem, escalations can be configured to route it to secondary engineers or operations managers.

To learn more, see [PagerDuty](https://www.ibm.com/devops/method/content/manage/tool_pagerduty/){: new_window}.


## Sauce Labs
{: #saucelabs}

Sauce Labs allows you to run functional unit tests. When a Sauce Labs test suite is configured as a test job in the {{site.data.keyword.deliverypipeline}}, the test suite can run tests against your web or mobile app as part of your continuous delivery process. These tests can provide valuable flow control for your projects, acting as gates to prevent the deployment of bad code.

To learn more, see [Sauce Labs](https://www.ibm.com/devops/method/content/code/tool_sauce_labs/){: new_window}.


## Slack
{: #slack}

Slack is a cloud-based, real-time messaging and notification system. Slack provides persistent chat, which is a more interactive alternative to email for team collaboration. You can communicate with your team on a dedicated channel or on a set of channels that is related directly to your work. You can also share files and images through the channels or in direct messages between two or more people. Chats and channel communications are retained and you can search them.
