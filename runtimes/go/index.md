# Go
{: #go_runtime}
*Last updated: 16 March 2016*

The Go runtime on {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix}} is powered by the go_buildpack.
The go_buildpack provides a complete runtime environment for Go
apps.
{: shortdesc}

The go_buildpack is used if your application contains a file named *.go.

## Starter application
{: #starter_application}

{{site.data.keyword.Bluemix}} provides a Go starter application.  The Go starter application is a simple Go app that provides a template that you can use for your app. You can experiment with the starter app, and make and push changes to the Bluemix environment  See [Using the starter applications](../../cfapps/starter_app_usage.html) for help with using the starter application.

## Runtime versions
{: #runtime_versions}

You can specify the version of Go to be used by your app by setting the GoVersion property in the Godeps/Godeps.json file at the root of your application. For example:

```
{
	"ImportPath": "gohelloworld",
	"GoVersion": "go1.3.3",
	"Deps": []
}
```
