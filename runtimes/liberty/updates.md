* Refer to the [Upcoming Liberty for Java buildpack changes](https://developer.ibm.com/bluemix/2015/09/08/upcoming-liberty-for-java-buildpack-changes/) blog post for details about these changes and how they may affect your application.
* The buildpack also introduces app_state configuration option to disable the appstate feature via the JBP_CONFIG_LIBERTY environment variable. The appstate feature integrates with the Cloud Foundry health check process to ensure the Liberty application is fully initialized before the application can receive HTTP requests. To disable the appstate feature, you can set the JBP_CONFIG_LIBERTY environment variable to “app_state: false”.

### September 4, 2015: Updated Liberty buildpack v1.22-20150824-1104

### May 27, 2015: Updated Liberty buildpack v1.18-20150519-1642
* The buildpack contains an updated version of the Liberty profile based on the [May beta](https://developer.ibm.com/wasdev/blog/2015/05/08/beta-liberty-and-tools-may-2015/).

### May 5, 2015: Updated Liberty buildpack v1.17-20150501-1729
* The buildpack contains an updated version of the Liberty profile based on the [April beta](https://developer.ibm.com/wasdev/blog/2015/04/10/announcing-liberty-beta-with-tools-aprilmay-2015/).

* The buildpack also provides initial support for Java 8. IBM JRE 7.1 remains the default JRE but IBM JRE 8 can be enabled for an application by setting the JBP_CONFIG_IBMJDK environment variable. Configuring version of OpenJDK is also supported. See [Customizing the JRE](customizingJRE.html) for all the details.
* The buildpack provides a new JBP_CONFIG_LIBERTY environment variable that can be used to override the default set of Liberty features enabled for an application when it deploys a WAR or EAR file. See [Stand-alone Applications](optionsForPushing.html#stand_alone_apps) for more information.
* The service plug-in for the [Monitoring and Analytics Service](../../services/monana/index.html) was updated to reduce the size of logs that are generated for the service.
* With this version of the buildpack, the way the application files are laid out in the droplet changed. The change in the file structure eliminated complexity that is related to maintaining symbolic links and should have no impact on the applications.

* When stand-alone WAR files are deployed, if provided, the buildpack now uses the context-root that is specified in the embedded **ibm-web-ext.xml** file as the application's context root. With this change, applications that were previously deployed under the root context might be deployed under a different context based on the settings in the **ibm-web-ext.xml** file.

* The [SQL Database](services/SQLDB/index.html#SQLDB) service offers paid plans that provide an option for connecting with the database server over the SSL protocol. The buildpack's auto-configuration support for SQL Database service was updated to configure the runtime to connect with the database over SSL if the SSL connection information is available.
* The buildpack was updated to report an error when a stand-alone WAR or EAR file that contains a **server.xml** configuration file in root of the application archive is deployed.
* The buildpack contains a fix for MongoDB's auto-configuration service plug-in that in certain cases generated an invalid **server.xml** configuration.

Only stand-alone web applications are supported.

### February 6, 2015: Updated Liberty buildpack v1.12-20150130-1016
* The buildpack contains an updated version of the Liberty profile based on the [January beta](https://developer.ibm.com/wasdev/blog/2015/01/16/announcing-liberty-beta-tools-january-2015/).

### December 19, 2014: Updated Liberty buildpack v1.10-20141218-0103
* The buildpack provides a development mode for applications. The development mode is a special mode that allows developers to conduct many activities for an application instance that were not possible before. By using this feature, this version of the IBM Eclipse Tools for Bluemix can now support remote debugging with incremental file updates against a Liberty application that is running in Bluemix. This makes it convenient for a developer that uses Eclipse to debug an application in the cloud and apply changes to that application instantly.
* The buildpack also contains an updated version of the Liberty profile based on the [December beta](https://developer.ibm.com/wasdev/blog/2014/12/10/announcing-liberty-beta-december/).
* In addition, the following four Liberty features that were previously available as beta features, are now production-ready:
  * concurrent-1.0
  * jsonp-1.0
  * servlet-3.1
  * websocket-1.0.
* The buildpack provides integration with the New Relic service. Once an application is bound to the New Relic service, the buildpack automatically downloads and configures the runtime with the New Relic agent.
* The buildpack has the following known limitations:
  * When in development mode, a SessionCache service cannot be bound.
  * When in development mode, a thread dump cannot be created.
  * When using the servlet-3.1 or websocket-v1.0 feature, the Monitoring & Analytics service cannot be bound.

### December 5, 2014: Updated Liberty buildpack v1.9-20141202-0947
* The buildpack provides an enhanced JVM option support. The JVM options can now be applied with a restart operation. Restaging of the application is not necessary. Also, the default JVM options are optimized for fast failure and pre-configured with a common location that makes it easy to find the generated dumps. More details are provided in the [Custom Configuration of Java JVM for the Liberty Runtime article](https://developer.ibm.com/bluemix/2014/12/12/custom-configurations-java-jvm-liberty-runtime/).
* The buildpack contains an updated DB2 JDBC driver version 4.17.29.

The new data collector collects diagnostic deep dive information, which enables users of the Diagnostics plan of the service to diagnose problems with their applications, down to the specific line of code.
* The buildpack contains updated versions of the management and auto-scaling agents that include bug fixes and minor improvements. It also includes an updated version of the [Liberty profile](https://developer.ibm.com/wasdev/) and [Java MongoDB Driver](https://docs.mongodb.org/ecosystem/drivers/java/), v2.12.3.
* In the cloudAutowiring feature, a bug that caused resource injection errors in some applications was fixed.

### October 3, 2014: Updated Liberty Buildpack v1.5-20140923-1143
