# Using the beta features
{: #using_beta_features}

*Last Updated: 23 March 2016*

The Liberty beta features provide early access to new functionality and programming models that might be included in a future Liberty release. Most of the beta features can also be used in applications deployed to Bluemix.

**Important**: The beta features are for development and test purposes only and may not be used in production. For the complete terms of use please see the [beta license agreement](http://public.dhe.ibm.com/ibmdl/export/pub/software/websphere/wasdev/downloads/wlp/beta/lafiles/en.html).

In order to use the Liberty beta features in Bluemix you will need to do either:

1. [Deploy a server directory or a packaged server](optionsForPushing.html) with one or more beta features enabled in the server.xml file as in the example that follows:
```
    <server>
        <featureManager>
            <feature>jsp-2.3</feature>
            <feature>passwordUtilities-1.0</feature>
        </featureManager>
    </server>
```
{: #codeblock}

2.  Set the IBM_LIBERTY_BETA environment variable to **true**. This variable directs the Liberty buildpack to install and enable the beta features for your application.  See the following examples:
  * using the cf command line tool:
<pre>
       $ cf set-env <yourappname> IBM_LIBERTY_BETA true
</pre>
{: #codeblock}

  * or, using the manifest.yml file:
<pre>
      env:
          IBM_LIBERTY_BETA: "true"
</pre>
{: #codeblock}
