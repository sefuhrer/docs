<dd>{{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} Public and Dedicated enable intrusion protection to discover threats so that they can be addressed. Intrusion protection policies are enabled on firewalls.</dd>

<dt>Secure application container management</dt>
<dd>Each {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} application is isolated and runs in its own container that has specific resource limits for processor, memory, and disk.</dd>

<dt>Operating system security hardening</dt>
<dd>IBM administrators perform network and operating system hardening regularly by using tools such as IBM Endpoint Manager.</dd>
</dl>

### Operational security

{{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} provides a robust operational security environment with the following controls.

<dl>
<dt>Vulnerability scan</dt>
<dd>{{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} uses the Tenable Network Security vulnerability scanning tool, Nessus, to detect any issues with network and host configurations so that the issues can be resolved.</dd>

<dd>{{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} administrators ensure that fixes for operating systems are applied at appropriate frequencies. Automated fixes are enabled by using IBM Endpoint Manager.</dd>

<dt>Audit log consolidation and analysis</dt>
<dd>{{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} uses the IBMSecurity QRadar® tools to consolidate Linux logs to monitor privileged access on Linux systems. {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} also uses IBM QRadar security information and event management (SIEM) to monitor successful and unsuccessful login attempts of application developers.</dd>

<dt>User access management</dt>
<dd>Within {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}}, Separation of Duties guidelines are followed to assign granular access privileges to users, and to ensure that users have only the access that is required to perform their jobs according to the principle of least privilege.

Within a {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} Dedicated and Local environments, assigned administrators can manage roles and permissions for {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} user in their organization by using the Admin Console. See [Managing {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} Local and Dedicated](../admin/index.html#mng) for details.
</dd>
</dl>

### Physical security

{{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} Public and Dedicated relies on the network-within-a-network topology of SoftLayer for physical network security. This network-within-a-network architecture ensures that systems are fully accessible only to authorized personnel. For {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} Local, you own the physical security for the local instance. Your data center is secured behind your company firewall.

In SoftLayer network-within-a-network, the public network layer handles public traffic to hosted websites or online resources. The private network layer allows for true out-of-band management through a distinct stand-alone third carrier over SSL, PPTP, or IPSec VPN gateways. The data center to data center network layer provides free and secure connectivity between servers that are housed in separate SoftLayer facilities.

Every SoftLayer data center is fully secured with controls that meet SSAE 16 and industry-recognized requirements, without exceptions. For more information, see the SoftLayer Security Compliance page.

## Data security
{: #data-security}

With {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}}, securing your data against unauthorized access is a joint effort between {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} and you.

Data that is associated with a running application can be in one of three states: data-in-transit, data-at-rest, and data-in-use.

<dl>
<dt>Data-in-transit</dt>
<dd>Data that is being transferred between nodes on a network.</dd>

<dt>Data-at-rest</dt>
<dd>Data that is stored.</dd>

<dt>Data-in-use</dt>
<dd>Data that is not currently stored, and is being acted upon at an endpoint.</dd>
</dl>

Each type of data needs to be considered when you plan for data security.

The {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} platform secures data-in-transit by securing the end-user access to the application by using SSL, through the network until the data reaches IBM DataPower Gateway at the boundary of the {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} internal network. IBM DataPower Gateway acts as a reverse proxy and provides SSL termination.

Security for both data-in-use and data-at-rest is your responsibility as you develop your application. You can take advantage of several data-related services available in the {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} Catalog to help with these concerns.

## Security of {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} applications
{: #application-security}

As an application developer, you must enable the security configurations, including application data protection, for your applications that run on {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}}.

You can use security capabilities that are provided by several {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} services to secure your applications. All {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} services that are produced by IBM follow IBM secure engineering development practices.

**Note:** Some of the services described here might not apply to Bluemix Dedicated or Local instances.

### SSO service

IBM Single Sign On for {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} is a policy-based authentication service that provides an easy to embed single sign-on capability for Node.js or Liberty for Java™ applications. To enable an application developer to embed single sign-on capability into an application, the administrator creates service instances and adds identity sources.

The Single Sign On service supports several identity sources where your users' credentials are stored:

<dl>
<dt>SAML Enterprise</dt>
<dd>A user registry with an exchange of SAML tokens that completes the authentication.</dd>

<dt>Cloud Directory</dt>
<dd>A user registry that is hosted in IBM Cloud.</dd>

<dt>Social identity sources</dt>
<dd> The user registries that are maintained by Google, Facebook, and LinkedIn.</dd>
</dl>

For more information, see [Getting started with Single Sign On](../services/SingleSignOn/index.html).

### Application Security on Cloud

### dashDB

The dashDB service uses an embedded LDAP server for user authentication. The connection between applications and the database is protected by SSL certificates. This service uses the DB2® native encryption capability to automatically encrypt your deployed database and database backups. Master key rotation is automatic and happens every 90 days.

For more information, see [Getting started with dashDB](../services/dashDB/index.html).

### Cloud Integration

The Cloud Integration service enables you to integrate cloud and on-premises data. You can add a service to interact with backend databases such as DB2, Oracle, and SAP. Next, you can move data or create REST APIs for {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} applications to access and use. The service enables secure communication with on-premises secure connectors, and exposes backend systems of record as REST APIs to be used by applications.

For more information, see [Getting started with Cloud Integration](../services/CloudIntegration/index.html).

### Secure Gateway

The Secure Gateway service enables you to securely connect {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} apps to remote locations, either on premises or in the cloud. It provides secure connectivity and establishes a tunnel between your {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} organization and the remote location that you want to connect to. You can configure and create a secure gateway by using the {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} user interface or an API package.

For more information, see [Getting started with Secure Gateway](../services/SecureGateway/secure_gateway.html).

### SQL Database

The SQL Database service adds a fully provisioned relational database to your app. This service uses IBM Directory Server LDAP for authentication and IBM InfoSphere® Guardium® Data Activity Monitor to protect the database that is accessed by applications. The connection between applications and the database is protected by the SSL certificate that DigiCert signs.

In certain plans with this service, you can use the SQL database console in {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} to get reports that contain the following information:

 * Sensitive data that might exist in the database that is accessed by applications.
 * The application users who accessed the database within a specified period.
 * The application users who are accessing sensitive data that is in the database.

To mask data by using SQL, applications can call the masking user-defined functions (UDFs) that are deployed together with the database. For example, you can mask the data that you want to use elsewhere for testing. The UDFs implement the data masking algorithms from IBM Infosphere Optim™.

The premium plan for this service also includes data encryption. For more information about this service, see [Getting started with SQL Database](../services/SQLDB/index.html).

### Security information and event management

You can use security information and event management (SIEM) tools to analyze security alerts in application logs. One such tool is IBM Security QRadar&reg; SIEM, which provides security intelligence in cloud environments. For information, see [IBM QRadar Security Intelligence Platform](http://www-01.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SS42VS/welcome?lang=en){: new_window}.
